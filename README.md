# MRI_Recon_Tutorial

Some basic tutorials on MRI reconstruction data or models.

- Acquisition and Sampling
  - The MRI acquisition and sampling tutorial is largely borrowed from [Philouc/mri_acq_recon_tutorial](https://github.com/philouc/mri_acq_recon_tutorial/) with some changes to fit the requirement of recent updates.
- Datasets: datasets and preprocessing
  - The fastMRI dataset processing tutorial is borrowed from [fastMRI](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastMRI) an. Thanks for making such a good dataset publicly available :)
    - [Dataset_preview](https://github.com/YuyangXueEd/MRI_Recon_Tutorial/tree/main/Datasets/FastMRI/dataset_preview.ipynb): A preview on val or train dataset of FastMRI.
    - [Zero filled](https://github.com/YuyangXueEd/MRI_Recon_Tutorial/tree/main/Datasets/FastMRI/zero_filled.ipynb): A simple baseline to demonstrate a submission. 
- Models: baselines and SOTA models
  - [U-Net](https://github.com/YuyangXueEd/MRI_Recon_Tutorial/tree/main/Models/unet): fastMRI baseline model. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08839)
