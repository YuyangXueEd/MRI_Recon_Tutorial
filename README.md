# MRI_Recon_Tutorial

Some basic tutorials on MRI reconstruction data or models.

- Acquisition and Sampling
  - The MRI acusition and sampling tutorial is largely borrorwed from [Philouc/mri_acq_recon_tutorial](https://github.com/philouc/mri_acq_recon_tutorial/) with some changes to fit the requirement of recent updates.
- Datasets: datasets and preprocessing
  - The fastMRI dataset processing tutorial is borrowed from [fastMRI](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastMRI). Thanks for making such a good dataset publicly available :)
- Models: baselines and SOTA models
  - [U-Net]: fastMRI baseline model. [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08839)
